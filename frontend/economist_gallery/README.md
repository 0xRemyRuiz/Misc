2014 Economist Gallery
======================
This was just a quick and fun project to help me remember economists at a time when I thought I wanted to do management more than coding... Turns out I preferred to code this than to study even though I loved learning about economics, laws and maths. I do not regret but I think I missed coding and computer science in general too much.
